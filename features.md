| Goofys                                    | JupyterLab Extension (Client)        | Goofys allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a filey system. It's a Filey System instead of a File System because goofys strives for performance first and POSIX second. Particularly things that are difficult to support on S3 or would translate into more than one round-trip would either fail (random writes) or faked (no per-file permission). Goofys does not have an on disk data cache (checkout catfs), and consistency model is close-to-open.                                                                                                                                                               |           |
